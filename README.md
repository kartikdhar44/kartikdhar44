## 🧠 About Me

I'm a passionate **Game Programmer** currently working at **Reliance Games**, contributing to mobile titles like *American Dad Apocalypse Soon* using **Unity (C#)**. With a strong foundation in **Java**, **C++**, and **C#**, I enjoy building scalable systems and exploring the crossroads of **gameplay programming**, **systems engineering**, and **backend services**.

I’m actively sharpening my expertise in **Unreal Engine C++**, aiming to build **AAA-quality mini-projects** — from third-person combat systems to advanced AI with Behavior Trees — to break into **R&D or engine teams** at companies like Crytek or idTech.

## 💼 Current Focus

- 🔧 **Unreal Engine 5** — Developing portfolio projects with advanced animation and combat mechanics.
- ⚙️ **Spring Boot + Unity** — Integrating Java backend with mobile game clients.
- 🧪 Building a deeper understanding of **low-level game engine architecture** and **C++ memory management**.
